    Problem Statement: Employee Retention Prediction
The task at hand is to develop a predictive analysis model that can accurately identify employees who are most likely to leave the company in the near future. This employee retention prediction is crucial for businesses to proactively forecast employee behavior and take necessary measures to retain valuable talent, ensuring that the company doesn't lose essential manpower.

By leveraging data and predictive modeling techniques, we aim to create a solution that can effectively identify the factors contributing to employee attrition and develop insights into which employees are at the highest risk of leaving. This information will enable businesses to implement targeted retention strategies and interventions to increase employee satisfaction, engagement, and ultimately reduce attrition rates.

The desired outcome is to build a reliable model that can predict employee churn with a high level of accuracy, allowing organizations to proactively address retention concerns, retain valuable employees, and maintain a stable and productive workforce.

                            Interpretation, conclusion and recommendation  

The logistic regression model performed well in predicting employee retention based on the classification report. Here is a summary of the model results:

Precision: The precision of 80% indicates that 80% of the predicted positive cases (employees predicted to leave) were actually true positives. In other words, when the model predicted that an employee would leave, it was correct 80% of the time.

Recall: The recall of 83% implies that the model identified 83% of the actual positive cases (employees who left the company). It captures a high proportion of employees who actually left, indicating a good ability to detect attrition.

F1-score: The F1-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing an overall measure of the model's performance. The F1-score of 80% (weighted average) suggests a balanced performance in terms of both precision and recall.

Accuracy: The accuracy of 83% indicates the overall correctness of the model's predictions. It signifies that the model correctly classified 83% of the cases, both positive (employees who left) and negative (employees who stayed).

These results suggest that the logistic regression model has demonstrated good predictive ability in identifying employees who are likely to leave the company.

In conclusion, the analysis reveals that overworked employees, high workload, and low job satisfaction are contributing factors to employee attrition. Based on these findings, the following recommendations can be made to retain employees and improve overall employee satisfaction:

Implement a project workload management system: Set limits on the number of projects employees can handle simultaneously to prevent excessive workload and burnout. This can help employees maintain a healthy work-life balance.

Focus on retention of four-year tenured employees: Investigate the reasons behind the low satisfaction levels among employees who have been with the company for four years. Address any specific issues or concerns they may have and consider implementing targeted retention strategies for this group.

Evaluate overtime policies: Review the company's overtime policies and ensure that employees are properly rewarded or compensated for working longer hours. Communicate these policies clearly to employees to avoid any misunderstandings or dissatisfaction related to compensation.

Foster a healthy work culture: Hold company-wide and team-specific discussions to better understand the work culture and identify areas of improvement. Encourage open communication and provide opportunities for employees to voice their concerns, suggestions, and feedback.

Revise performance evaluation criteria: Reassess the performance evaluation system to ensure that high evaluation scores are not solely based on the number of hours worked. Consider implementing a more comprehensive and balanced approach that recognizes and rewards employees for their contributions, effort, and results rather than solely focusing on work hours.

Moving forward, the next steps could include implementing these recommendations and monitoring their impact on employee retention and satisfaction. Regularly assessing employee engagement and conducting surveys or feedback sessions can provide valuable insights for further improvements. Additionally, ongoing analysis and tracking of employee attrition patterns can help identify emerging trends and take proactive measures to address them effectively
